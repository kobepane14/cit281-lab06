cit281 lab-06
<p>Learn and become familiar with GitHub through an intro course. Practice using Classes, and creating Class methods by creating a library Class, and a book Class, and adding newly created books into a library instance. I learned how to create instances of classes, use contructors to set parameters, use the this keyword, and create class methods. This lab gave great practice utilizing classes and creating methods to give control over instances.</p>
